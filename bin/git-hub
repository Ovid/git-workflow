=head1 NAME

git-hub - Checkout branch from github, by issue number, creating the branch if necessary

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    git hub $issue_id # checkout the branch for $issue_id

=head1 CONFIG

To use this script, it must find a I<readable> file named F<.git-hub> in the
current directory. The file should be in the following format:

    user  MyGithubUserName
    repo  NameOfMyRepo
    token GithubOathToken

For information on creating the Github oath token:

https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This helper script makes it easier (and more consistent) to check out a branch
from the current branch, based on a github ticket number. There are several possible
outcomes:

=over 4

=item * No branch found

If the issue is open and no branch for the issue id is found, a new branch
with a "command line friendly" title (along with issue number) will be
created.  For example, for issue 5738, with the title "Rework reputation to
handle faction conflict" is used, the following two commands are equivalent:

    git hub 5738

    git checkout -b rework-reputation-to-handle-faction-conflict-5738

=item * One branch found

If the issue is open and one branch matching that issue number is found, this
command is equivalent to:

    git checkout $branch_name

The branch name is found by matching C</\b$issue_id\b>, so this is a heuristic check.

=item * Multiple branches found

If multiple branch names match the regex C</\b$issue_id\b/>, you will see a
message similar to the following, with an exit code of 2:

    $ git hub 2415
    You must check out your branch manually.
    The following branches may match your issue id (2415):

        remotes/origin/combat-phases-2415
        remotes/origin/rework-combat-phases-2415

Naturally this is a heuristic check and may fail.

=item * Issue closed

If the issue is closed, you will get a message similar to the following, with
an exit code of 1:

    Issue https://github.com/myname/myrepo/issues/2415 closed on 2017-12-20T15:46:07Z
